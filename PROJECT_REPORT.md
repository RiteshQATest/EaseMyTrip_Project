## Recent Issues & Fixes

### Issue #1: Missing Import for `expect` Statement
**Problem:** `ReferenceError: expect is not defined`  
**Root Cause:** The HomePage class used `expect()` assertions without importing the function from Playwright  
**Solution:** Added `const { expect } = require('@playwright/test');` to HomePage.js  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### Issue #2: Undefined Browser Reference
**Problem:** `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'close')`  
**Root Cause:** The `closeBrowser()` method attempted to call `this.browser.close()` but `browser` was never initialized. Only the `page` object is passed to the constructor.  
**Solution:** Changed `this.browser.close()` to `this.page.close()`  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/homepage.spec.js

# Run in headed mode for debugging
npx playwright test tests/homepage.spec.js --headed
```

   - Add tests for login/signup functionality

2. **Page Object Model Improvements:**
   - Add more page locators as methods
   - Implement explicit waits for dynamic content
   - Add error handling and retry logic

3. **Infrastructure:**
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
   - Set up cross-browser testing (Firefox, WebKit)
   - Implement test parallelization

4. **Documentation:**
   - Add inline code comments
   - Create contributing guidelines
   - Document test data requirements
